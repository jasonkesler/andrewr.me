My name is Andrew Richardson, and I make things for iOS and the web. Designing and building beautiful software to solve complex problems is my passion.

I have extensive experience developing for iOS, through both traditional apps and tweaks for jailbroken devices. I also do front-end web development, and some back-end work with node.js too.

I currently study Computer Science at UBC in Vancouver, Canada. I am also a former intern at companies like Apple and SAP.
