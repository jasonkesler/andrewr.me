I’m Andrew Richardson, and I’m an iOS developer, UI designer, and student living in Vancouver, BC.

I’ve been developing for iOS for over two years, working primarily outside the bounds of the App Store to change the way iOS works for the better. My goal is to create elegant and innovative interface solutions to complex problems. Working with talented designers as well as with designs of my own, I love to take these designs and make them a reality. This can be seen in my flagship projects Jukebox and Merge, with more ambitious projects on the way.

I’m also a third-year student majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I'm into tech, hockey, and skiing, among other things.
