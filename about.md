My name is Andrew Richardson, and I make things for iOS and the web. Designing and building beautiful software to solve complex problems is my passion.

I have extensive experience developing for iOS, through both traditional apps and tweaks for jailbroken devices. I have also done a fair bit of web development (this site, for example).

I currently study Computer Science at UBC in Vancouver, Canada. I am also a former intern at companies like Apple and SAP.

You can follow me on [Twitter]({{site.twitter}}) or get in touch with me [here](mailto:{{site.email}}).
