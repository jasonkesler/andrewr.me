          Jukebox is the way to control your music on iOS. Offering a beautiful and
          minimalistic aesthetic, while also providing a robust set of controls,
          Jukebox changes the way you interact with your music for the better. The
          controls are revealed with a single tap, so they don’t get in between you
          and  your music when you don’t need them. Simply swipe to the left or right
          to view the next or previous song, and swipe further to skip to that song.
        

          This is only the tip of the iceberg of what Jukebox has to offer. Intuitive
          gestures. One-tap sharing to Twitter and Facebook. Full support for third-
          party apps. Compatibility with every device running iOS 5 and up. For only
          $0.99, Jukebox gives you everything you’d ever need in a music widget.

        summary: Conversations made simple
        description: >
          Ever tried to send a message to a contact with more than one number or
          address in the iOS Messages app? If so, you probably know what a pain it is
          to keep track of each conversation and to switch between them. It doesn’t
          help that Messages conceals which address you’re currently sending to,
          either.


          Enter Merge. The idea is simple: unify all messages with the same contact
          into a single thread. No more switching between conversations to read
          messages from one person. It just makes sense. And switching between sending
          addresses is equally simple — it’s just a tap-and-hold on the Contact
          button. At $1.49, Merge delivers on a feature that should have been a part
          of iOS from the beginning. Created in tandem with Joshua Tucker.

          Open in Chrome is simple, yet effective — it replaces Safari with Google
          Chrome as the default browser for iOS. Links from all apps, as well as
          searches from Spotlight and Siri, all open in Google Chrome when installed.
          It also supports custom search engines selected from the Settings app. And
          it’s all open-source.

          Why clutter the iOS Settings app with dedicated panes for widgets?
          WeePreferenceLoader is an open-source framework that makes it easy to
          integrate widget settings where they belong — in the dedicated Notification
          Center settings. It is simple yet robust, and designed using existing
          conventions to make moving widget settings a breeze.

        summary: Slide annotation prototype for tablets

        description: >
          Lectures have come a long way since the advent of PowerPoint, but in an age
          where everything is moving online, lectures are as cumbersome to digitize as
          ever. The lecture recorder aims to change that, by offering a single tool
          for recording lectures and annotating slides, optimized for modern tablets.
          Developed as an HCI project at UBC.
