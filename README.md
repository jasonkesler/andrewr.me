# andrewr.me

This is the source for my site, [andrewr.me](http://andrewr.me). It is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and makes heavy use of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for automating the build process. The design is based on a heavily-modified version of [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).

The site includes my blog, projects, and the depictions setup for Cydia. It is MIT-licensed.
