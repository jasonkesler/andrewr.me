title: A Fresh Start
---

It's been over a year since I first launched my site. At the time, I intended to use it as a vehicle to learn my way around web development and to start blogging. I succeeded at the former, in the sense that I made a ton of mistakes that I won't be making again (such as writing all of the HTML manually like a fool). But I was never satisfied with how my blog was set up [^1], and so it stagnated.

[^1]: It was set up as a Tumblr blog with messy and hard-to-maintain CSS. It didn't help that Tumblr once lost hours of my finely-tuned CSS changes for no reason, either.

A few months ago, I decided to give it another shot, with a fresh start and a far cleaner site design in mind. It took me quite some time, working incrementally and iterating over a design I'd mocked up a long time ago, but in the end I wound up with a site I feel much more proud of than before. It's a statically-generated Jekyll site built using modern tools [^2], and designed from the start to be responsive. It's also far more pleasant to blog for than before, thanks to the ability to write in Markdown and to make any customizations I like with ease.

[^2]: SASS, Grunt.js, Bower, Browserify â€” the list goes on. Some of them weren't worth the effort to integrate, but others (like SASS) have been invaluable in developing a well-organized, maintainable site.

It took more work than I would have liked to build this site, but I'm quite happy with the end result. Will this actually translate to more writing on my part? We'll find out soon enough.
